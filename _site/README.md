# **What2Eat**

**What2Eat** is a smarter way to rank restaurants, moving beyond simple averages and review counts. By incorporating reviewer traits, recency, and subjective biases, it calculates more reliable and nuanced scores to identify the best dining spots.

---

## **Why Not Just Use Simple Averages?**

### 1. **Subjective Reviewer Bias**
- Different reviewers have varying standards: 
  - A score of 4 might mean "excellent" for one reviewer but "average" for another.
- Simple averages ignore the reviewing habits of individuals, which can distort rankings.

### 2. **Review Count Issues**
- **Too many reviews**: Larger datasets dominate rankings even with marginally better scores.
- **Too few reviews**: Small sample sizes can skew results dramatically (e.g., two perfect reviews result in an unrealistic 5.0 score).

### 3. **Time Sensitivity**
- Restaurants change over time. 
  - Renovations, staff changes, or declining quality aren't reflected in outdated reviews, which simple averages treat equally.

### 4. **Reviewer Credibility**
- Active and experienced reviewers (e.g., influencers or food critics) provide more reliable insights.
- Treating all reviewers equally diminishes trust in rankings.

### 5. **Vulnerability to Manipulation**
- Ratings can be inflated or deflated through fake reviews or coordinated attacks, skewing simple averages.

## **How What2Eat Solves These Problems**

### **Step 1: Individual Review Adjustment**
Each review is evaluated on three dimensions:
1. **Reviewer Bias (`score_scaled`)**: How the review compares to the reviewerâ€™s average ratings.
2. **Recency (`date_scaled`)**: Newer reviews carry more weight, reflecting current restaurant quality.
3. **Reviewer Credibility (`badge_scaled`)**: Reviewers with higher levels or badges are weighted more heavily.

The adjusted review score is calculated as:

\[
\text{Combined Score} = (0.5 \times \text{score\_scaled}) + (0.2 \times \text{date\_scaled}) + (0.3 \times \text{badge\_scaled})
\]

---

### **Step 2: Restaurant-Level Scoring**
Restaurant scores are derived by aggregating individual review scores using Bayesian Adjusted Averages. This method accounts for the number of reviews and avoids over-rewarding or penalizing restaurants with very few reviews.

\[
\text{Restaurant Score} = \frac{(\mu \times k) + (\bar{x} \times N)}{k + N}
\]

Where:
- \( \mu \): Global average score.
- \( k \): Minimum review count threshold (e.g., 5).
- \( \bar{x} \): Restaurant's average combined score.
- \( N \): Number of reviews for the restaurant.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Personalized Adjustments**: Scores reflect reviewer habits, recency, and credibility.
- **Robust Rankings**: Bayesian adjustments reduce the impact of outliers and small sample sizes.
- **Manipulation-Resistant**: Incorporates reviewer activity to mitigate spam or biased reviews.

## **How It Works**
Hereâ€™s how you can complete the sections:

---

## ðŸ“Š How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Over 1.5 million reviews from 1,650,000+ Seoul restaurants were collected from Kakao Map.
   - Data includes reviewer ID, scores, review text, timestamps, and additional metadata like reviewer badges or levels.

2. **Review Analysis**: 
   - Each review is evaluated using three factors:
     - **Reviewer Bias**: How a reviewâ€™s score compares to the reviewerâ€™s typical scoring pattern (`score_scaled`).
     - **Recency**: Reviews written within the last 3 months are weighted higher, with older reviews gradually losing weight (`date_scaled`).
     - **Reviewer Credibility**: Reviewers with higher activity levels or badges receive more influence (`badge_scaled`).
   - These factors are normalized and combined into a **Combined Score** for each review.

3. **Ranking System**:
   - **Individual Review Aggregation**:
     - Reviews for each restaurant are combined using **Bayesian Adjusted Averages**, ensuring restaurants with fewer reviews are not unfairly overrepresented.
   - **Final Score Calculation**:
     \[
     \text{Restaurant Score} = \frac{(\mu \times k) + (\bar{x} \times N)}{k + N}
     \]
     - \( \mu \): Average of all restaurantsâ€™ combined scores.
     - \( k \): Minimum review count threshold (e.g., 5).
     - \( \bar{x} \): Restaurantâ€™s average combined score.
     - \( N \): Number of reviews for the restaurant.

4. **Display Criteria**: 
   - Restaurants are ranked by their **Bayesian Adjusted Scores**.
   - Additional filters include:
     - **Cuisine Type**: Narrow down results by category (e.g., Korean, Italian, Cafes).
     - **Location**: Filter by specific areas or neighborhoods.
     - **Recency**: Highlight restaurants with a high volume of recent positive reviews.
   - Each restaurant's page includes:
     - **Detailed Score Breakdown**: Combined score components (bias, recency, credibility).
     - **Review Trends**: A timeline of scores to show consistency or changes over time.
     - **Popular Dishes**: Insights derived from review text analysis (e.g., frequent mentions of menu items).

This breakdown should give a clear understanding of the workflow while emphasizing the projectâ€™s precision and scalability. Let me know if further refinement is needed!

---

## **Sample Use Case**
Imagine Restaurant A has 2 reviews with a perfect 5.0 average, while Restaurant B has 100 reviews averaging 4.8.  
- **Simple Average**: Restaurant A ranks higher due to the perfect score.  
- **What2Eat Ranking**: Restaurant B scores higher because its large review base makes its score more reliable.
